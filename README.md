# Game Overview:
### Title: Lighthouse Defense
### Engine: Godot
### Genre: Tower Defense
### Platform: Web
## Game Concept:

Lighthouse Defense is a web-based tower defense game set in the courtyard of a lighthouse. Players defend themselves against waves of creatures in the dark using the rotating light of the lighthouse as their only source of visibility. Survive as long as possible by strategically shooting enemies while managing limited resources and health.

## Gameplay Mechanics:

Movement: Players can move horizontally and vertically within the courtyard using arrows or WASD.

Shooting: Players aim and shoot their gun using the mouse cursor. Clicking fires a shot in the direction of the cursor.

Reloading: Players reload their weapon when the ammo runs out by using the R key.

Health: The player has a limited number of hit points. When hit by enemies, hit points decrease. The game ends when hit points reach zero.

Scoring: Players earn points for every enemy they eliminate. Points contribute to the player's high score.

Lighthouse Red Alert: Every 2-minute interval, the lighthouse's light turns red. For the next 30 seconds, creatures move twice as fast and spawn twice as much.

## Premise:

Players find themselves trapped in the courtyard of a lighthouse, surrounded by darkness. The only illumination comes from the rotating beam of the lighthouse. Mysterious creatures emerge from the darkness, seeking to attack the player. Survive as long as possible using wit, reflexes, and limited resources to fend off relentless waves of enemies.
